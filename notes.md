# Notes

Sorry for the delay in responding, especially with such a kind offer to help sift through this data. What I think would be helpful is figuring out the most common combination of diagnosis.
 
Of the 9,572 children in our study, the top five diagnosis when they come into care are:
1,045 ADD/ADHD (learning disability)
*733 Other (I’m seeking clarification on what this means, so I’m not including it in my top 5 right now)
326 Oppositional Defiant Disorder
231 Mood Disorder (incl. Bipolar and Dysthymic)
227 Depression
160 PTSD
 
Autism was up next, 103 cases. So even of those diagnosed with ADD/ADHD – what were the most common diagnosis also associated with that child? I can figure it out with filters, but would be curious if you have another way.
 
As for reporting the data, I think I will group some of these similar diagnosis together so as to say “2,500 had a mental health illness when they came into care, oppositional defiant disorder being the most common.” I TOTALLY just made that last sentence up as an example. But here are the key categories I see:
 
Mental Health:
Oppositional Defiant Disorder
Adjustment Disorder
SED: Seriously Emotionally Disturbed (Anxiety Disorder/Attachment Disorder/Separation Anxiety)
Mood Disorder
Dissociative Disorder
Emotionally Disturbed
Schizophrenia (Schizoaffective and personality disorders)
Impulse control
PTSD
Sex disorder
 
Mental/Neurological Impairments
Cerebral Palsy
Intellectual Disability (Developmental Disability/Cognitive Disorder/Mental Retardation)
ADD/ADHD (learning disability)
Autism (Pervasive Development Disorder)
 
Physical/Medical Impairments:
Asthma
Allergies
Anemia
Diabetes
Failure to Thrive
Downs Syndrome
Enuresis
Hearing impairment
Fetal Alcohol Syndrome
Visually impaired
Mobility impaired
 
Behavior:
Disruptive Behavior Disorder
Conduct Disorder
